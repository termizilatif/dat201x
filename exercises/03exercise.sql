< < Generating Invoice Reports > >

AdventureWorks Cycles sells directly to retailers, who must be invoiced for their orders. You have been tasked with writing a query to generate a list of invoices to be sent to customers.

-- Write a query that returns the company name from the Sale.Customer table, the sales order ID and total due from the SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader table. Make sure to use the aliases provided, and default column names elsewhere.

SELECT c.CompanyName, oh.SalesOrderID, oh.TotalDue
FROM SalesLT.Customer AS c
JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS oh
ON oh.CustomerID = c.CustomerID;

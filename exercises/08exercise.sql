< < Retrieving Regional Sales Totals > > 

AdventureWorks sells products to customers in multiple country/regions around the world. An existing report uses the query provided in the editor to return total sales revenue grouped by country/region and state/province.

-- Modify the query so that the results include a grand total for all sales revenue and a subtotal for each country/region in addition to the state/province subtotals that are already returned. Make sure to use the aliases provided, and default column names elsewhere.

SELECT a.CountryRegion, a.StateProvince, SUM(soh.TotalDue) AS Revenue
FROM SalesLT.Address AS a
JOIN SalesLT.CustomerAddress AS ca
ON a.AddressID = ca.AddressID
JOIN SalesLT.Customer AS c
ON ca.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
JOIN SalesLT.SalesOrderHeader AS soh
ON c.CustomerID = soh.CustomerID
GROUP BY ROLLUP(a.CountryRegion, a.StateProvince)
ORDER BY a.CountryRegion, a.StateProvince;
